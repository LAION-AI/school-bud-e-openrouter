// islands/ChatAgreement.tsx
//
// The terms a visitor has to accept before the chat appears.
//
// This screen used to be unreliable: the box could be ticked and the button
// still did nothing, on some browsers always, on others only sometimes. Four
// separate things caused it, and all four are addressed here rather than
// papered over, because a person who cannot get past this screen cannot use
// anything at all.
//
//  1. The terms were rendered into a <p> with dangerouslySetInnerHTML, and
//     they begin with a <div>. A paragraph cannot contain block elements, so
//     every browser closes the <p> early and moves the rest up a level. The
//     DOM then no longer matches what Preact expects while hydrating, and the
//     click handlers end up on the wrong nodes - which is exactly the
//     "nothing happens" symptom, and why it differed between browsers.
//
//  2. Whether the button worked depended on a piece of state that only gets
//     set if onChange fires. Now the checkbox is read straight from the DOM
//     when the button is pressed, so a missed event cannot lock anyone out.
//
//  3. localStorage.setItem throws in Safari's private mode. The exception
//     came out of the click handler and the page simply sat there. It is
//     caught now, and refusing to store the agreement no longer refuses the
//     visitor entry.
//
//  4. The page reloaded itself to show the chat, which meant a second
//     opportunity for all of the above. It now tells its parent directly.
